# Longest Increasing Subsequence Assessment for HCL

## Project Objective
- As a developer, write a program to find the longest increasing subsequence.

## Background of the problem statement
- As a developer, write a Java code to find the longest increasing subsequence from a list of random numbers.

## Requirements
- Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application.
- Java: A programming language.
- Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub.
- GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions. 
- Core Java concepts: variables, data types, operators, type casting, control statements, class, objects, access specifiers, and core keywords like final, this, and static.
- The versions of the code should be tracked on GitHub repositories.
- The code should work properly for n numbers, where n<100.

## Description of Complete Project
- The current code finds the longest increasing subsequence within an overall sequence where the numbers in the subsequence contain numbers increasing consecutively.
- Within the App.java file there are some example Subsequences testing for subsequence locations within different parts of a set sequence.
- The program finds the <em>First</em> longest subsequence and returns <em>only</em> that subsequence if there are multiple 'longest' subsequences of equal size
- There are also Four randomly generated Sequences created and run through the program where size is 's' and the range is 'r', where the range is from 0 to r.
    - First random sequence has s = 10, r = 10
    - Second random sequence has s = 100, r = 20
    - Third random sequence has s = 1000, r = 20
    - Fourth random sequence has s = 1000, r = 40
